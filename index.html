        <h1>Hi! I'm Jeroen</h1>
        <p>I'm a student communication & multimedia design. Currently I am in my second year. I like to build websites but also design the functionality of them.</p>
        <p>These are some of my skills:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML/CSS</li>
          <li>A bit of JS</li>
          <li>Video editing with Vegas Pro</li>
        </ul>

      <button id="moreButton">More about me</button>

        <div id="moreParagraph" class="hideParagraph">
          <h2>More about me</h2>
          <img src="#" alt="Jeroen in a picture">
          <p>I like to tinker with computers, mainly software. An example may be that I use a so called hackintosh (non-apple computer that runs MacOS). That tinkering got me to learn HTML & CSS</p>
          <p>In my spare time I like to go <a>windsurfing</a> or play games. I also really like to go <a>skiing</a> (although due to travel time and cost I don't do this often. Living in the Netherlands isn't ideal for this..). I also like to edit video of my ski trips and windsurf sessions. That way I thought myself how to edit in Vegas Pro.</p>

        <h2>Professor Layton puzzle in JavaScript</h2>
        <p>This is the project I made for 'inleiding programmeren' a subject at which I learned the basics of JavaScript. I really liked building this small game as I had never used JS before. Learning JS really was an eye opener as to what can be done with a static HTML/CSS/JS page.</p>
