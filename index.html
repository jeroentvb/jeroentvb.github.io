        <p>Ik ben een student communication &amp; multimedia design. Ik zit momenteel in mijn tweede jaar. Ik vind het leuk om websites te bouwen maar ook om defunctionaliteit ervan te ontwerpen. So basically a frontender with some affinity for UX/interaction. You may notice that I'm not a very good visual designer. I usually make things pretty when I have acces to a styleguide.</p>

          <h2>More about me</h2>
          <p>I like to tinker with computers, mainly software. An example may be that I use a so called hackintosh (non-apple computer that runs MacOS). That tinkering got me to learn HTML &amp; CSS</p>
          <p>In my spare time I like to go <a href="skiwindvid.html">windsurfing</a> or play <a href="snowedits.html">games</a>. I also really like to go <a href="skiwindvid.html">skiing</a> (although due to travel time and cost I don't do this often. Living in the Netherlands isn't ideal for this..). I also like to edit video of my ski trips and windsurf sessions. That way I thought myself how to edit in Vegas Pro.</p>
          <p>These are some of my skills:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML & CSS/SASS (SCSS)</li>
            <li>A bit of JS</li>
            <li>Photoshop</li>
            <li>Some InDesign</li>
            <li>Video editing with Vegas Pro</li>
          </ul>

        <a href="projects/project-web/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/project_web.jpg" alt="Project_WEB website"></a>
        <h2>Project WEB - Stories website for the NS</h2>
        <p>This was a fictional project for the NS. It's a website on which travellers can find and read stories before, while and after travelling. The whole site is in Dutch.</p>
        <p>The website is completely hand-made in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (with a few JS library's). I learned a lot about semantic HTML and how to make a website responsive while working on this project.</p>
        <p>Project documentation can be found <a href="projects/project-web/ontwerpdocument3.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, it's all in Dutch.</p>

        <h2>Professor Layton puzzle in JavaScript</h2>
        <p>This is the project I made for 'inleiding programmeren' a subject at which I learned the basics of JavaScript. I really liked building this small game as I had never used JS before. Learning JS really was an eye opener as to what can be done with a static HTML/CSS/JS page.</p>
        <p>Note: the app has sound and doesn't scale well on mobile devices.</p>

        <h2>Visual Interface Design</h2>
        <p>I made this project for the subject 'visual interface design' at which I learned how to make a working prototype in invision and learned a bit about micro interactions.</p>
        <p>I was pretty pleased with the end result as I generally don't think my work looks pretty. For the first time ever I used (google's material) design guidelines and that made the outcome look a lot better than I expected.</p>

        <h2>JvB Logo</h2>
        <p>This is the logo I made for myself. Although I don't find my graphic design skills very good I am really happy with the result. The only downside is that it doesn't work on darker colors, that's why I made a white variant which you can see in the upper left hand side in the menu bar.</p>

        <h2>Ski vacation/windsurf films</h2>
        <p>These are personal video projects of my skiing vacations and windsurf sessions.</p>
        <p>I tought myself how to edit video with Vegas Pro.</p>
        <p>Note that I haven't uploaded the full length films as they are 30+ minutes each and I don't expect anyone to watch them.</p>

        <h2>SNOW edits</h2>
        <p>In my free time I sometimes like to create a SNOW edit. SNOW is a open world winter sports game with a pretty good replay editor built in. That way I can record the tricks I perform in the game and throw them together to make a so called 'edit'. I like doing this because I have full control over the shots, editing, music etc.</p>
