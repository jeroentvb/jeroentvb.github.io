        <p>I'm a student communication &amp; multimedia design. Currently I am in my second year. I like to build websites but also design the functionality of them. So basically a frontender with some affinity for UX/interaction.</p>
        <p>This website is handcrafted with HTML/CSS/JS and is responsive. Take a look at the code <a href="https://github.com/jeroentvb/portfolio" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          <h2>More about me</h2>
          <p>I like to tinker with computers, mainly software. An example may be that I use a so called hackintosh (non-apple computer that runs MacOS). That tinkering got me to learn HTML &amp; CSS.</p>
          <p>In my spare time I like to go <a href="skiwindvid.html">windsurfing</a> or play <a href="snowedits.html">games</a>. I also really like to go <a href="skiwindvid.html">skiing</a> (although due to travel time and cost I don't do this often. Living
            in the Netherlands isn't ideal for this..). I also like to edit video of my ski trips and windsurf sessions. That way I thought myself how to edit in Vegas Pro.</p>
          <p>These are some of my skills:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS/SASS (SCSS)</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Photoshop</li>
            <li>Some InDesign &amp; Illustrator</li>
            <li>Video editing with Premiere Pro &amp; Vegas Pro</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Project tech - backend</h2>
        <p>For this project I had to make a datingwebsite with a self-written backend. The backend consists of nodejs and the express framework.</p>
        <p>I focussed most on learning nodejs, which was quite challenging. Therefore I had less time to focus on the UX and frontend.</p>
        <p>More information about this project and the code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jeroentvb/project-tech">github.</a></p>

        <h2>Project WEB - Stories website for the NS</h2>
        <p>This was a fictional project for the NS. It's a website on which travellers can find and read stories before, while and after travelling. The whole site is in Dutch.</p>
        <p>The website is completely hand-made in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (with a few JS library's). I learned a lot about semantic HTML and how to make a website responsive while working on this project.</p>
        <p>Project documentation can be found <a href="../projects/project-web/ontwerpdocument3.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, it's all in Dutch.</p>

        <h2>Professor Layton puzzle in JavaScript</h2>
        <p>This is the project I made for 'inleiding programmeren' a subject at which I learned the basics of JavaScript. I really liked building this small game as I had never used JS before. Learning JS really was an eye opener as to what can be done with
          a static HTML/CSS/JS page.</p>
        <p>Note: the app has sound and doesn't scale well on mobile devices.</p>

        <h2>Visual Interface Design</h2>
        <p>I made this project for the subject 'visual interface design' at which I learned how to make a working prototype in invision and learned a bit about micro interactions.</p>
        <p>I was pretty pleased with the end result as I generally don't think my work looks pretty. For the first time ever I used (google's material) design guidelines and that made the outcome look a lot better than I expected.</p>

        <h2>Audio Visual Design</h2>
        <p>This was the subject I chose next to all the technical subjects in the profiling trimester. I found that making a professional film consumed way more time (and preperation!) than I expected.</p>

        <h2>JvB Logo</h2>
        <p>This is the logo I made for myself. Although I don't find my graphic design skills very good I am really happy with the result. The only downside is that it doesn't work on darker colors, that's why I made a white variant which you can see in
          the upper left hand side in the menu bar.</p>

        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
        <p>On my portfolio website I put projects which I'm most proud of, and this website is one of those projects.</p>
        <p>I had fun building this website outside of school, which I don't do often due to the lack of a subject to make a website for.</p>
        <p>I tried using SASS (SCSS) for the first time building this website which made writing CSS a easier, clearer and more fun to write.</p>
        <p>The website is responsive.</p>

        <p>These are personal video projects of my skiing vacations and windsurf sessions.</p>
        <p>I tought myself how to edit video with Vegas Pro.</p>
        <p>Note that I haven't uploaded the full length films as they are 30+ minutes each and I don't expect anyone to watch them.</p>

        <h2>SNOW edits</h2>
        <p>In my free time I sometimes like to create a <a href="http://www.snowthegame.com/" target="_blank">SNOW</a> edit. SNOW is a open world winter sports game with a pretty good replay editor built in. That way I can record the tricks I perform in the game and throw them together to make a so called 'edit'.
          I like doing this because I have full control over the shots, editing, music etc.</p>
